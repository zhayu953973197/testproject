 * Description: Flash protection APIs.
 * @li The flash chip register is configured so that the flash chip does not respond to the SPI erase and write
 * operations.
 * @li Both non-volatile and volatile flash protection registers are supported. When the status of the volatile
 * register conflicts with that of the non-volatile register, the status of the volatile register prevails.
 * @li Generally, the non-volatile register is set to the full-chip protection mode. When the system is rebooted,
 * the flash memory is in the full-chip protection state by default.
 * @li When a partition in the flash memory needs to be erased, the flash memory is de-protected by using the
 * volatile register (implemented inside the driver). After the operation is complete, the volatile register
 * restores to the protection state.
 * @li During version upgrade, to prevent the target version from not supporting flash de-protection, full-chip
 * de-protection is performed (non-volatile and volatile protection registers). Full-chip de-protection needs
 * to be called by the upgrade module proactively. \n
